# FilterPixel Hiring Challenge: Image Processing Web Server with Real-Time Preview

## Objective
Build a full-stack image processing web application that accepts image uploads, processes them on the backend, and provides real-time previews of the manipulated image. Users can download the final processed image in their desired format (PNG or JPEG).

## Features Checklist

- [x] **Image Upload**
  - Users can upload images in PNG or JPEG format.
  - Backend validates the file type and stores it temporarily.
  
- [x] **Real-Time Image Processing**
  - Low-quality previews are generated for fast real-time feedback.
  
- [x] **Image Conversion**
  - Convert images between PNG and JPEG.
  
- [x] **Brightness Adjustment**
  - Slider for adjusting image brightness in real-time.
  
- [x] **Contrast Adjustment**
  - Slider for adjusting image contrast in real-time.
  
- [x] **Saturation Adjustment**
  - Slider for adjusting image saturation in real-time.
  
- [x] **Image Rotation**
  - Rotate images from 0-360 degrees with real-time preview.
  
- [x] **Image Cropping**
  - Select a specific part of the image and crop it.
  
- [x] **Final Image Download**
  - Download the fully processed image in PNG or JPEG format.
  - Final image download is in high quality.
  
- [x] **Reset**
  - Reset all image manipulations and return to the original state.
